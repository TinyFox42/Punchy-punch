Ok, so, instead of an overly complicated "every attack/block combination has its own check", a list of damage and protection types.
So, yeah, this is going to be a list of attack types and such

First off, there is dodge. It is the chance that an attack completly misses, but is generally lowered by some other protection

Main group: Physical/kinetic:
	*Blunt - lowest damage, but hardest to block. At lot of blocked damage gets turned into this (partially)
	*Slash - medium damage, harder to block. Swords and stuff. Can be blocked by many types of armor, but some of it is turned into blunt
	*Pierce - Highest damage, very hard to block. Guns, arrows, and some swords. Rare to be blocked by armor, and a lot of it will be turned into blunt

Temperature group:
	Thermal damage:
		Oh noes! You are being heated up/cooled down. Hopefully you packed your thermal gear. Harder to protect against, especially over time, but is a rare form of damage.

	Fire damage:
		Well, someone just put an ignition source close to you. Is your armor flammable? Hopefully not.
		Can destroy some equipment, or just start dealing damage over time if you get lit on fire.

	EM damage:
		Well, this is interesting... Someone is shining a bright light on you. Hopefully its not heating you up too much. Or burning through your stuff.

	Frozen (status effect):
		You know, I don't even know how this happened. Or if it is even possible. Part of your body is frozen in a block of ice. Have fun with this.

So, quick list of a few weapons:
	*Club- punch stuff! Deals 5 blunt damage
	*Sword - slash stuff! Deals 7 slashing damage, or 4 blunt damage
	*Gun - deals 10 piercing damage, or 1 blunt damage (Later on, I should check if this should be 1 or 0. I feel like a bullet won't kill you if it is stopped from piercing the skin, but I don't know how much it will hurt you.)

Armor:
	*Padded jacket - quarter stops shash, fails to stop peirce, blocks 75% of blunt damage
	*Chain mail - Stops slashing damage, half stops pierce, stops 5% of the resulting blunt
	*Bulletproof vest - Stops piercing damage, quarter stops slash, stops 25% of the blunt
