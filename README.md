# Punchy-punch
Pending name for a simple turn-based RPG game

This is a simple game, and still in development.
With the current plan, this game will stay as a simple command-line based game.
Instructions on how to use it will come after it resembles some form of being playable.

Feel free to look through this as an example of how to make a game like this, download it to your computer and play it, or just about anything.
Feel free to distribute it, as long as you give credit to this repository for where you got it. Every program needs a nice easter egg.
